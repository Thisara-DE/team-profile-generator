# Team-Profile-Generator
  ## Description
  The main purpose behind this project was to demonstrate my knowledge on ```OOP (object oriented programming)``` and ```TDD (test driven development)```. Please refer to the ```__tests__``` folder for all the tests I prepared to test out the objects' properties and methods. I chose ```Jest``` as the ```testing framework``` for this project. This application is using ```fs module``` and ```inquirer``` npm package apart from Jest.
